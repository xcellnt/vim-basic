# before u do keep in mind if u are learning it for first time, i recommend u stick with vanila vim version for the couple of weeks. So u just learn the basic stuff, key bindings, basic funcions, basic settins, and command. And if u've basic done u can install some plugins and customize ur setup to do that

 - install noevim
 - install plugins = github: vim-plug
 - setting = not on .vimrc but /.config/nvim/init.vim
 - setting to install plugins exmaple
	call plug#begin()
		Plug here type url plugin
	call plug#end()
 - after setup type :PlugInstall
 - if u want vim bindings on anohter IDE u can install on extension
